### Hello! My name is Omar Omar, yeah it's OmarÂ² ðŸ‘‹

I have recently obtained a bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. I do not currently have a specific CS Topic that I enjoy the most, I mainly enjoy projects. No matter what tools or languages they use, Projects excite me ðŸ˜†.
- ðŸ”­ I finished a Senior Design Project Mobile Application using ReactNative, NodeJS, and MongoDB
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Mobile Development Frameworks, Tools, and Techniques (*My First Mobile Dev Venture*)
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to Collaborate on ANYTHING that is a fun Project ðŸ¤£
- âš¡ Fun Fact: I always strive to do things differently (*Weird is Cool!*)
