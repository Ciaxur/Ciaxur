### Hello! My name is Omar Omar, yeah it's Omar² 👋

I am a Final Year Computer Science Major at the University of Michigan. I do not currently have a specific CS Topic that I enjoy the most, I mainly enjoy projects. No matter what tools or languages they use, Projects excite me 😆.
- 🔭 I finished a Senior Design Project Mobile Application using ReactNative, NodeJS, and MongoDB
- 🌱 I am currently learning Mobile Development Frameworks, Tools, and Techniques (*My First Mobile Dev Venture*)
- 👯 I'm looking to Collaborate on ANYTHING that is a fun Project 🤣
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I always strive to do things differently (*Weird is Cool!*)
