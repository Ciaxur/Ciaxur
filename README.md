### Hello! My name is Omar Omar, yeah it's OmarÂ² ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Michigan. I do not currently have a specific CS Topic that I enjoy the most, I mainly enjoy projects and solving problems. No matter what tools or languages they use, projects excite me.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on designing an API service that distributes and manage application configurations (*Work Related*)
- ðŸŒ± I am currently educating myself on the world of finance and data science (*Curious venture*)
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to Collaborate on ANYTHING that is a fun & challenging Project
- âš¡ Fun Fact: I always strive to do things differently (*Weird is Cool!*)
